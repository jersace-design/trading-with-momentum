# Trading with Momentum 

### Overview 
Implemented a momentum trading strategy and tested if it has the potential to be profitable. 
I worked with historical data of a given stock universe and generated a trading signal based
on a momentum indicator; computed the signal to produce projected returns.

Performed statistical tests to conclude whether there is an alpha in the signal.
